# Ethics Statement for News Search and Analysis Application

## Introduction
This ethics statement outlines our commitment to responsible use of AI and web scraping technologies in our News Search and Analysis Application. We recognize the ethical implications of collecting, processing, and analyzing web content using automated systems and large language models (LLMs), and we are committed to upholding ethical standards in our operations.

## Responsible Web Scraping

### Respect for Website Policies
- We respect robots.txt files and website terms of service
- Our application implements throttling mechanisms to prevent server overload
- We identify ourselves properly through user agent strings
- We recognize and honor HTTP status code 403 (Forbidden) responses

### Data Minimization
- We extract only the content necessary for analysis
- Content is truncated when excessively long to minimize unnecessary data collection
- We implement appropriate timeouts and error handling to avoid unintended resource consumption

## Responsible AI Use

### Transparency
- We clearly indicate when content has been processed or generated by AI models
- Our application distinguishes between factual information extracted from sources and AI-generated analysis
- We maintain transparency about the limitations of AI-generated insights

### Misinformation Prevention
- Our system is designed to cite sources and maintain provenance of information
- The distillation process preserves attribution to original sources
- We encourage critical evaluation of AI-generated reports

### Model Selection
- We use appropriate models for different tasks (GPT-3.5 for query enhancement, GPT-4 for content analysis)
- We adjust temperature and other parameters to optimize for accuracy over creativity when dealing with factual content

## Privacy Considerations

### Data Handling
- User queries are processed solely for the purpose of information retrieval
- We do not retain user search histories beyond the session unless explicitly authorized
- Search results are stored temporarily for the purpose of analysis and are not shared with third parties

### Consent and User Control
- Users have control over how recent the news content should be
- The application provides visibility into each processing step
- Users can review raw content before AI processing occurs

## Intellectual Property

### Attribution
- Our application maintains clear attribution to original sources
- We respect copyright by presenting limited extracts for analysis purposes
- We operate within fair use/fair dealing principles by focusing on analysis rather than reproduction

### Content Transformation
- The distillation process is designed to transform content into insights while respecting intellectual property rights
- Generated reports include citations to original sources

## Accessibility and Bias

### Equal Access
- We strive to make information accessible through clear summarization
- Our application helps users process information that might otherwise be overwhelming in volume

### Bias Mitigation
- We acknowledge that AI models may contain biases from their training data
- Our multi-stage process (search, extraction, distillation, report generation) aims to reduce the impact of any single source of bias
- We encourage users to review multiple sources to get balanced perspectives

## Limitations and Disclaimers

- Our application is a research and information tool, not a replacement for professional judgment
- AI-generated analyses should be critically evaluated and verified
- The application has technical limitations including potential for blocking by websites and inherent limitations of underlying models

## Commitment to Improvement

We are committed to:
- Regular ethical review of our practices
- Updating our techniques to align with evolving ethical standards
- Being responsive to concerns about our application's impact
- Continuous improvement of our technical safeguards

## Conclusion

This ethics statement reflects our understanding that powerful information tools come with significant responsibilities. We strive to provide valuable analysis capabilities while respecting the rights of content creators, website operators, and users, and to contribute positively to the information ecosystem.
